\title{Detect local shape outliers with a residual matrix}
\usage{
detect_onoffout(resmat, rawmat, exonset, winlength = 100, readconstr = 10,
  siglev = NULL, cutoff = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{resmat}{a residual matrix from PCA, a data matrix subtracted by a low-rank matrix.}

\item{rawmat}{a raw coverage matrix, dataI from \link{process_data}}

\item{exonset}{exon/intron annotation matrix from \link{annotate_pileup}}

\item{winlength}{the window size. Default is 100.}

\item{readconstr}{the minimum reads count required to be considered for on/off local shape changes.
Default is 10.}
}
\description{
This function identifies local shape variants by mining locally on/off abnormalities.
